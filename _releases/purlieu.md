- Boomkat

> Panatype’s 4th physical release is an absorbing suite of electronica
  uniquely gelling ideas from 4th world ambience, Artificial
  Intelligence and Virtual Reality in four lushly detailed scenes.
  Conceived in pursuit of an aesthetic that seeks to “blur the line
  between field recordings and synthesis in order to render invented
  and impossible landscapes”, Puech’s first release for Panatype
  extends an immersive invitation to his singular, simulated
  dimensions. Using mostly modular synth, coupled with self-built
  devices, Puech plots out his imaginary world in electronic
  filigree. Blended with inspiration from the overgrowing chaos and
  mathematic logic of nature in a similar way to the Transflora
  project, his works are self-contained environments that could be
  considered different aspects of the same, alternate world. As with
  nature, Puech’s music can veer from modest beauty to barely
  controlled attacks on the senses, with his favoured, extended
  palette of machines enabling him to emulate the complex sounds of
  animals, albeit mutant ones that you may expect to be limned by
  Ballard or Google dream, especially when it all comes together in
  the side-long title track.
