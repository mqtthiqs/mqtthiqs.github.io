### 4ms Tapographic Delay

Co-designed with [4ms](http://4mspedals.com/) and developed the
firmware for this [Eurorack
module](https://4mscompany.com/p.php?p=790), manufactured and
commercialized by [4ms](http://4mspedals.com/). The Tapo is a complex
multi-tap delay which lets the user enter the delay configuration she
wants by means of a velocity-sensitive tap sensor. Up to 32 taps per
configuration, smooth morphing between configurations, two feedback
paths, and much more.

### Xaoc Devices Batumi

Re-developed from scratch and improved upon the main firmware for this
[Eurorack module](http://xaocdevices.com/main/batumi/), starting from
the existing hardware, and developed an alternative "expert" firmware
for [Xaoc Devices](http://xaocdevices.com/), adding advanced
functionality. The open-source code can be found
[here](https://github.com/xaocdevices/batumi).
