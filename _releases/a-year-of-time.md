# Reviews

- _The Wire_ (Byron Coley, Issue 406 December 2017)

> Excellent cassette of homemade synth sounds from the Paris based
  Puech (who is, I gather, a scientist for his day job.) The music is
  broken into four suites (as befits a year) and is just great. While
  it owes certain ghost debts to English and German antecedents, its
  manner of tone bending is fresh and unique. There are space jiggles
  moments that recall early Gong at their zoniest, and layered blasts
  the make me think of prime Tangerine Dream, but for the most part
  this tape visits previously explored quadrants in new ways. Quite an
  accomplishment.
