## About

Matthias Puech is a composer, designer, programmer, researcher and
teacher from Paris. From a scientific background, he nourishes a dual
fascination for natural phenomena and mathematical concepts. His
compositions, contemplative stills of imaginary landscapes, intend to
blur the distinction between sound synthesis and field recording,
transporting the listener amidst invented ecosystems. Puech designs
and programs his own digital electronic instruments with the help of
unique synthesis algorithms inspired from physics and biology.

His music is in major part composed and interpreted on modular
synthesizers, using specially-developed hardware and software. He
collaborates with several Eurorack modules manufacturers who build and
commercializes his creations (e.g., the 4ms Tapographic Delay).
